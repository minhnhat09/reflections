What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a folder named .git and it track on changes made 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a intermediate zone between working directory and commit directory, that's all ?
So, if we aren't sure about our changes we save this in the staging area first. Once it's all worked, we do a commit.
if we do a commit each time we wanna save a small change, it can have a lot of commits, it's not a best way to use git

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I don't understand the question but I try to answer, I have to add all files which have been changed (in red) to the staging area and do a commit one time?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When I want to try some new ideas and don't want to change a master branch. But the idea is the same of staging area or commit. Where the difference ?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can visualize all branches in the project
